    <h1>Test For Show Promise That Resolves With Empty Dictionary</h1>
    <p>This page can be used to test the show promise that resolves with an
    empty dictionary. It simulates the page being undecisive about the total
    amount and modifiers for the first 5 seconds after showing the payment
    sheet. The payment sheet should be in the "spinning" mode. After the 5
    seconds, the final price will be unchanged at <strong>$1.00</strong> with a
    modifier for <strong>visa</strong> cards that make the total
    <strong>$2.00</strong>.</p> 
    <p>Price: USD <strong>$1.00</strong> ($2.00 for VISA cards) <em>(tentative)</em></p>
    <p><button onclick="onBuyClicked()" id="buyButton"> Buy </button></p>
    <p>No payment will be processed.</p>
